# RSphere
This is a quantum visualisation tool that help you get a grasp of quantum states with a more intuitive approach.

# Installation

To tun the program go to the Build folder and choose your OS.

# Indication on the software

Their are a few things you need to know about quantum computing to run the software, first the qubit starts on the |0> state you can eaither apply gates to change its state or use the slider which is here to help put the qubit on a certain state.

Like in classical computing you have gates to change the state of a qubit .For the different gates implemented you have the Hadamard gate (H-gate) that puts the qubit in a perfect superposition, Then you have the X-Gate or Not gate that reverse the state of the qubit and finaly the RZ-Gate or rotation gate that changes the phase of the qubit.

When you clic on the measurement button the qubit fonction wave will collapse to choose a value either 1 or 0 according to his state, if it is in perfect supperposition you will have the same chance to get the |0> state and the |1> state, etc. The more the cirlce is full the more chance you have to get the |1> state on measurement.

This is a very simple implementation more gates will be added soon.
